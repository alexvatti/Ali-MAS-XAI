**Phase-01:  Model Development**

1. Created datasets for Top 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 Web Service Categories.
2. Cleaned and preprocessed the data (stopwords removal, label encoding).
3. Extracted features using TF-IDF and SBERT embeddings.
4. Trained ML models (LogReg, Random Forest, XGBoost) and a Deep Learning model (BI-LSTM).
5. Evaluated using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score.


**Phase-02: Enhanced Model Development**

1. Merged and balanced datasets across **Top 50 Web Service Categories** to ensure **uniform class distribution**.
2. Cleaned and  preprocessing (cleaning, label encoding) to align with the merged structure.
3. Extracted features using **TF-IDF** and **SBERT embeddings** on the updated dataset.
4. Trained models: **Logistic Regression**, **Random Forest**, **XGBoost**, and **BI-LSTM**.
5. Evaluated using **Accuracy**, **Precision**, **Recall**, and **F1-Score** to benchmark improvements.
