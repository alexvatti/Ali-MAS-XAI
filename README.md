1. Created datasets for Top 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 Web Service Categories.
2. Cleaned and preprocessed the data (stopwords removal, label encoding).
3. Extracted features using TF-IDF and SBERT embeddings.
4. Trained ML models (LogReg, Random Forest, XGBoost) and a Deep Learning model (BI-LSTM).
5. Evaluated using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score.
